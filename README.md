# University Database using Microsoft Access
A relational database made in Access which is used for structuring randomly generated student data. 
The process for making this database is described as follows:
- Created relationships and constraints using an Entity Relationship Diagram.
- Created a relational schema to meet the business needs of the theoretical university.
- Developed the entity relationship diagram and relational schema in LaTeX using the TiKZ `er` package. 
- Implemented the entity relationship diagram and relational schema in Microsoft Access.
- Manually added randomly generated data into the database.
- Developed SQL queries to fetch data concerning . . . 

The entity relationship diagram and the relational schema are developed in LaTeX.
I cannot share the code for the ERD because I by mistake over-wrote the original code.
